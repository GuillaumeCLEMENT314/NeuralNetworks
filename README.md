Here, we setup different models and compare their performance on differentiating handwritten numbers. The best achieved accuracy on the test dataset (dataset used only after the model has been trained and validated) is 99.22%.
Before creating the model, we perform data import, preparing and set up iterators for learning process and evaluation process.
